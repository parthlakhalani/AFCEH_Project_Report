# Network Reconnaissance and Information Gathering

This repository contains the project report and resources for **Network Reconnaissance and Information Gathering**, conducted as part of the **Ankit Fadia Certified Ethical Hacking Program (Batch 7)**. The project demonstrates the application of ethical hacking tools and techniques to identify network vulnerabilities and gather essential information for security analysis.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The aim of this project is to perform a comprehensive **network reconnaissance and information-gathering scan** on the target website **www.penguinbooksindia.com**. The report details the methodology, tools, and observations used to uncover potential vulnerabilities in the target system.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques

The following tools and techniques were used:
- **Ping**: Check if the target is online/offline.
- **Traceroute**: Analyze network topology and packet paths.
- **DNS Tools**: Perform WHOIS queries and gather domain-related information.
- **Nmap/Zenmap**: Identify open ports, software versions, and OS details.
- **Daemon Banner Grabbing**: Extract service and version information.
- **Security Auditing Tools**: Detect system vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

## üöÄ Key Steps

1. **Online Status Check**: Verified if the target system is online using `ping` and bypassed firewall blocks with advanced Nmap commands.
2. **Network Topography**: Mapped packet paths to identify key nodes using Traceroute.
3. **DNS Analysis**: Gathered WHOIS data, including admin contact details, server IPs, and domain info.
4. **Port Scanning**: Detected open ports and identified running services using Nmap.
5. **Software and OS Detection**: Extracted software details (e.g., Apache HTTPD version 2.2.22) and identified operating systems using active and passive OS fingerprinting.
6. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Leveraged security auditing tools to identify critical loopholes in the target's infrastructure.

## üìä Observations

- Open Ports Detected:
  - **Port 21 (FTP)**: File Transfer Protocol
  - **Port 80 (HTTP)**: Web Service
  - **Port 554 (RTSP)**: Real-Time Streaming Protocol

- **Operating System**:
  - Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise
  - Linux-based systems with varying configurations

- Vulnerabilities found in outdated software versions (e.g., Apache HTTPD 2.2.22).
